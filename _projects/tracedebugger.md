A lightweight back-in-time debugger to trace and retrace method invocations and state changes.
It also supports [visualizing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/3594671.3594678) the evolution of objects.
TraceDebugger is built on the [SimulationStudio](https://github.com/LinqLover/SimulationStudio) framework, which modifies code interpretation without changing individual methods or the virtual machine.
